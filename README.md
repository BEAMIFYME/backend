# BEAMIFY.ME: Project BEME
#### BACKEND

## Description
This is the backend of the project BEAMIFY.ME. It is a RESTful Microservice API that provides functionalities to a host of services, which are provided as **Solutions** to be used 
by a frontend application. Essentially the backend is a BaaS (Backend as a Service). Fully built using [Nest Js]().

You can see and use our [API](https://api.beamify.me), which is fully documented. You only need to activate your **Dev Account** to get access to the API. This will then give you 
access to the API documentation, which details how to use our API.

## Easy Deployment
